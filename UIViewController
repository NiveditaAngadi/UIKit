UIViewController 

UIViewController class - an object that managers a view hierarchy for your UIKit app.

1. Defination of UIViewController 
The UIViewController class defines the shared behavior that’s common to all view controllers.

@MainActor 
class UIViewController: UIResponder 

2. What are the main responsibilities of ViewController?

1. Updating the contents of the views, usually in response to changes to the underlying data
2. Responding to user interactions with views
3. Resizing views and managing the layout of the overall interface
4. Coordinating with other objects — including other view controllers — in your app

3. Explain UIViewController. 
A view controller is tightly bound to the views it manages and taske part in handling events in its view hierarchy. 
Viewcontrollers are UIResponder objects, and are inserted into the responder chain between the viewcontroller's root view and that view's superview, 
which typically belongs to a different viewcontroller. 
If none of the view controller's views handles an event, the viewcontroller has the option of handling the event or passing it along to the superview. 

4. Explain about root view.
Each view controller manages view hierarchy, the root view of which is stored in the "view" property of this class, is primarily acts as container for the rest of the view hierarchy. 
The size and position of the root view is determined by the object that owns it, which is either a parent view controller or the app's window.
